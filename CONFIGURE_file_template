#TAG:			defines a class of features
#F_NAME:		feature's name - name within the same class have to be unique
#SEQ			sequence number (beginning with 0)
#POS_START		start and end positions (beginning with 0)
#POS_END
#INCR_SCORE_1:		add x to the score
#INCR_SCORE_2:		multiply score by x
#REDUCE_SCORE_1:	subtract x from the score
#REDUCE_SCORE_2:	divide score by x
#INCREASE_SCORE_FEAT:	features which increase score (can be either TAG+"_"+F_NAME or only the TAG), when specifying only the tag you can also exclude specific features from the set, e.g. PF[A] means all the features with the 'PF' tag except for the feature 'PF_A', subsequent exceptions separated with dots ('.'), e.g. 'PF[A.B]' - all PF except for PF_A and PF_B
#REDUCE_SCORE_FEAT:	features which reduce score
#
#- accepted whitespaces: only tabs (doesn't have to have them though)
#- tags and names should only consist of letters (can be both upper and lowercase)
