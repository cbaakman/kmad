Running KMAN

The simplest alignment of fasta sequences can be performed with the command:
kman -i input.fasta -o output_prefix -g 

To perform alignment with features you need to first create a '.7c' with 
'convertFastaTo7c.py'.
KMAN command for aligning with features is:
kman -i input.7c -o output_prefix -p 10 -d 3 -m 3 -c 7
